## Grocery Manager
- given a list of all food items you have and their expiry dates, schedules meals for you such that you do not waste it
    - configurable what your preferences are, will optimize accordingly
	    - (example: don't eat the same thing 3 days in a row, try to meet all 4 food groups, etc.)
	- list is (optionally) stored server-side and synchronized across other devices
- can be updated at any time if you don't follow the schedule and will recalculate as needed
- optionally deploy to Google Calendar
